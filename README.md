# Custom Mushroom Lamp
I created this project in an Informatics course I took at Indiana University called "Prototyping with Arduino Tools". One of the prompts for the main project in the course was to create a lamp device using the materials and instruction provided in the course.

For my project, I made a custom mushroom lamp with 8 different light modes that use capacitive touch to allow the user to easily change the light mode. Within this repository, I have included the code files I used to program the LEDs within the lamp. All code is written in C++ using the Arduino IDE and was uploaded to an Arduino Uno connected to the LEDs within the lamp structure.

To view the final product and my 3D modeling process, visit the mushroom lamp page on my website: https://kotten16.wixsite.com/otten-folio/mushroom-lamp
